/**
 * @brief inject a dll into the target process
 * @param processHandle handle of the process to inject to
 * @param threadHandle handle of the main thread in the process
 * @param dllname name/path of the dll to inject. The path can't be longer than MAX_PATH characters
 * @param initFunction name of the initialization function. Can't be longer than 20 characters.
 *                     If this is null, no function is called.
 *                     Important: the init function has to exist, be exported, take the two userdata parameters
 *                                and must be __cdecl calling convention on 32bit windows!
 *                                Failing any of these the target process will crash or the dll isn't loaded
 *                                Why __cdecl? Because otherwise we would need .def files to export the init function
 *                                with a GetProcAddress-able function name.
 * @param userData data passed to the init function
 * @param userDataSize size of the data to be passed
 * @param skipInit skip the call to the init function if the named function wasn't found in the
 *                 dll. If false, the target process will crash if the function isn't exported
 *                 in the dll
